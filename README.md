# SBND Distributons

Some preliminary distributions for SBND 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- These distributions were made using a normalised MiniBooNE flux
- I do have access to the SBND flux
    - Not in much depth so there is no harm in simply using this method for now
    - Eventually will get the full SBND flux information and will continue with this work
- Each file plots a different selection of distributions
